# What I would do differently if i would redo it again.
    .I will make sure I use Postman to make a first request so i can easyly identify the data I will need to display on the DOM


# Challenges I faced
    #I was struggling to get the data from the API key and update the UI accordingly,
        I have to review some of the previous code or solution to get that done.
    #I was struggling to get the errors and create a separated function to display the  on the DOM.

    #I was struggling to create some HTML element to display the data on the DOM.


With this project i got a little confidence on how to work with API key. Get the data and catch the errors. I also learned the importance of creating multiple functions so i can separate data fetching with DOM manipulation.
Next time I will make sure i do that.
